# Telco Customer Churn

For this notebook, you need to obtain the dataset. It can be acquired from either [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) or [IBM](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113).

This exploration is similar to the one on the [Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/sedihub/ml_explorations/tree/main/boston_housing_prices) dataset, except this time we have a classification problem. We are interested in seeing how far we can get by using a simple DNN.
