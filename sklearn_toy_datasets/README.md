# Sci-Kit Learn Toy Datasets

This short exploration focused on a number of classification and regression tasks based on Sci-Kit Learn's [toy datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html). These are certainly simple tasks. My goal, however, is to use them as test cases for some other related concepts.
