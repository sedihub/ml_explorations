# Deep Neural Network vs. Support Vector Machine

Support vector machines (SVM) classifiers used in conjuncture with a suitable kernel (e.g., RBF) provide can be quite effective. Deep neural networks are also quite effective in capturing complicated dependencies. In this exploration, we compare the two on engineered and random datasets.
