# Boston Housing Prices

In this notebook I explore the use of a fully-connected network on the Boston Housing Prices dataset, which only contains 400 samples in the training set. The results are better than I expected. This confirms my hunch that when it comes to DNNs regression tasks are more favorable from the perspective of learning.
